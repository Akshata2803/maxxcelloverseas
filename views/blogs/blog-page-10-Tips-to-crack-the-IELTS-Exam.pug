                    | 1.	In the Writing Section, pay attention to the number of words required for each task;you will lose marks if you do not write at least 150 words for Task 1 and at least 250 words for Task 2. Learn to recognize how long 150 and 250 words look in your handwriting; you will not have time to count during the test.

                    | 2.	Try to Google frequently misspelled words. There are words we feel we know the spellings for, but mostly the auto-correct corrects us. And it will come to a surprise that most commonly used words are often misspelled.

                    | 3.	In the Speaking Section, develop your own answers. Do not learn prepared answers; the examiner is trained to spot this and will change the question.Express your opinions; you will be assessed on your ability to communicate.

                    | 5.	In the Listening Section, do not panic if you think the topic is too difficult or the speaker is too fast; relax and tune in. Read, write and listen at the same time.Focus precisely on what you are asked to do in completion type questions.

                    | 8.  As you read, don’t try to understand the precise meaning of every word or phrase. You don’t have time, and those parts of the text might not be tested anyway.

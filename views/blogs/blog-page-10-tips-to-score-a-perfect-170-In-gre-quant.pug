                    | Algebra: Since basic algebra focuses on simplifying and manipulations of equations you need to practice by taking up simple problems followed by difficult ones.

                  p
                    | Whenever you’re stuck with a question that you think you cannot solve in the traditional way, you can employ the process of elimination as a backup strategy. It is a simple process where you eliminate options based on how irrelevant or wrong they sound in the context of the given question, and then end up with that one option that sounds the least incorrect to you. Then you choose that option and proceed.

                    | This will come in very handy during your GRE Quant practice. As you know there are applications for quant formulas like surface area and volumes. Most questions require taking a rational approach. It will be easier if you memorize the formulas. Maintain a handbook of GRE formulas.

                    | It’s not wrong to make mistakes, what’s wrong is making same mistakes again and again. This way, you will never learn. Log your mistakes so that they don’t get repeated. Taking the time to review your GRE Maths performance at the end of every test will result in greater confidence.

                    | While studying for the GRE, you must consciously balance the time you are spending on each chapter or concept that you learn. Sometimes, it is easy to go adrift and spend more time than necessary on a particular topic, or even a question. Always learn to balance your time, by allotting sufficient time slots for each and every topic in your study plan.

                    | Make sure you really understand the concepts underlying the question. One or two words can radically change the meaning. Don’t rush these challenging questions, even if the math seems fairly obvious; you’ll need to spend some time familiarizing yourself with “English-to-Math” translation tables.

                    |  For Data Interpretation questions, don’t rush to the problems. Read the titles, labels, units, and note the general trends of the data beforehand. How do the variables interact with one another? What general conclusions can be drawn about the presented information? You’ll know exactly where to find the correct answer if you already full grasp the data.

                    | Tough Geometry questions like to hide triangles with quadrilaterals, and circles within squares. Look for ways to apply information from one piece of the shape to another. Redraw the figures on your scratch pad if you need to – label everything.

                    |  When you practice for the GRE, avoid using a calculator unless you really need one. Most GRE Quant questions can be solved within 1-3 minutes without one. It’s provided on the GRE and allows for simple calculations, but don’t use it as a crutch. You should only need it for a couple of questions. You’ll save time if you can do simple conversions in your head.
